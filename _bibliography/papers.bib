  abstract  = {Multi-hydrogen lanthanum hydrides have shown the highest critical temperature <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> at 250-260 K under 170-200 GPa. However, such high pressure is a great challenge for sample preparation and practical application. To address this challenge, we propose a novel design strategy for ambient-pressure superconductors by constructing new few-hydrogen metal-bonded perovskite hydrides, such as Al-based superconductor Al<sub>4</sub>H, with better ductility than the well-known multi-hydrogen, cuprate and Fe-based superconductors. Based on the Migdal-Eliashberg theory, we predict that the structurally stable Al<sub>4</sub>H has a favorable <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> of up to 54 K under atmospheric pressure.}

abstract  = {The discovery of superconductivity in layered MgB<sub>2</sub> has renewed interest in the search for high-temperature conventional superconductors, leading to the synthesis of numerous hydrogen-dominated materials with high critical temperatures (<i>T<sub>c</sub></i>) under high pressures. However, achieving a high-<i>T<sub>c</sub></i> superconductor under ambient pressure remains a challenging goal. In this study, we propose a novel approach to realize a high-temperature superconductor under ambient pressure by introducing a hexagonal H monolayer into the hexagonal close-packed magnesium lattice, resulting in a new and stable few-hydrogen metal-bonded layered magnesium hydride (Mg<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>H<sub>1</sub>. This compound exhibits superior ductility compared to multi-hydrogen, cuprate, and iron-based superconductors due to its metallic bonding. Our unconventional strategy diverges from the conventional design principles used in hydrogen-dominated covalent high-temperature superconductors. Using anisotropic Migdal–Eliashberg equations, we demonstrate that the stable (Mg<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>H<sub>1</sub> compound is a typical phonon-mediated superconductor, characterized by strong electron–phonon coupling and an excellent <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> of 37 K under ambient conditions, comparable to that of MgB<sub>2</sub>. Our findings not only present a new pathway for exploring high-temperature superconductors but also provide valuable insights for future experimental synthesis endeavors.}

abstract  = {Very recently, the septuple-atomic-layer MoSi<sub>2</sub>N<sub>4</sub> has been successfully synthesized by a chemical vapor deposition method. However, pristine MoSi<sub>2</sub>N<sub>4</sub> exhibits some shortcomings, including poor visible-light harvesting capability and a low separation rate of photo-excited electron–hole pairs, when it is applied in water splitting to produce hydrogen. Fortunately, we find that MoSi<sub>2</sub>N<sub>4</sub> can be considered as a good co-catalyst to be stacked with InSe forming an efficient heterostructure photocatalyst. Here, the electronic and photocatalytic properties of the two-dimensional (2D) InSe/MoSi<sub>2</sub>N<sub>4</sub> heterostructure have been systematically investigated by density functional theory for the first time. The results demonstrate that 2D InSe/MoSi<sub>2</sub>N<sub>4</sub> has a type-II band alignment with a favourable direct bandgap of 1.61 eV and exhibits suitable band edge positions for overall water splitting. Particularly, 2D InSe/MoSi<sub>2</sub>N<sub>4</sub> has high electron mobility (10<sup>4</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) and shows a noticeable optical absorption coefficient (10<sup>5</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup>) in the visible-light region of the solar spectrum. These brilliant properties declare that 2D InSe/MoSi<sub>2</sub>N<sub>4</sub> is a potential photocatalyst for overall water splitting.}
