abstract = {The multi-hydrogen lanthanum hydride LaH<sub>10</sub> is well recognized as having the highest critical temperature (<i>T<sub>c</sub></i>) of 250–260 K under unrealistically ultrahigh pressures of about 170–200 GPa. Here, we propose a novel idea for designing a new ambient-pressure high-<i>T<sub>c</sub></i> superconductor by inserting a hexagonal H-monolayer into two close-packed Be monolayers to form a new and stable few-hydrogen metal-bonded layered beryllium hydride (Be<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>H nanosuperlattice, with better ductility than multi-hydrogen, cuprate, and iron-based superconductors, completely contrary to the conventional design strategy for multi-hydrogen covalent high-<i>T<sub>c</sub></i> superconductors with poor ductility at several hundred GPa. We find that (Be<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>H is a phonon-mediated Eliashberg superconductor with a large electron–phonon coupling constant of 1.41 and a high <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> of 84–72 K with Coulomb repulsion pseudopotential μ<sup>*</sup> = 0.07–0.13. Importantly, (Be<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>H is the only new high-<i>T<sub>c</sub></i> superconductor and fills the gap in the absence of ambient-pressure superconductors around the liquid-nitrogen temperature with good ductility, which is highly beneficial for practical applications.}

abstract  = {The discovery of superconductivity in layered MgB<sub>2</sub> has renewed interest in the search for high-temperature conventional superconductors, leading to the synthesis of numerous hydrogen-dominated materials with high critical temperatures (<i>T<sub>c</sub></i>) under high pressures. However, achieving a high-<i>T<sub>c</sub></i> superconductor under ambient pressure remains a challenging goal. In this study, we propose a novel approach to realize a high-temperature superconductor under ambient pressure by introducing a hexagonal H monolayer into the hexagonal close-packed magnesium lattice, resulting in a new and stable few-hydrogen metal-bonded layered magnesium hydride (Mg<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>H<sub>1</sub>. This compound exhibits superior ductility compared to multi-hydrogen, cuprate, and iron-based superconductors due to its metallic bonding. Our unconventional strategy diverges from the conventional design principles used in hydrogen-dominated covalent high-temperature superconductors. Using anisotropic Migdal–Eliashberg equations, we demonstrate that the stable (Mg<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>H<sub>1</sub> compound is a typical phonon-mediated superconductor, characterized by strong electron–phonon coupling and an excellent <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> of 37 K under ambient conditions, comparable to that of MgB<sub>2</sub>. Our findings not only present a new pathway for exploring high-temperature superconductors but also provide valuable insights for future experimental synthesis endeavors.}

abstract  = {Very recently, the septuple-atomic-layer MoSi<sub>2</sub>N<sub>4</sub> has been successfully synthesized by a chemical vapor deposition method. However, pristine MoSi<sub>2</sub>N<sub>4</sub> exhibits some shortcomings, including poor visible-light harvesting capability and a low separation rate of photo-excited electron–hole pairs, when it is applied in water splitting to produce hydrogen. Fortunately, we find that MoSi<sub>2</sub>N<sub>4</sub> can be considered as a good co-catalyst to be stacked with InSe forming an efficient heterostructure photocatalyst. Here, the electronic and photocatalytic properties of the two-dimensional (2D) InSe/MoSi<sub>2</sub>N<sub>4</sub> heterostructure have been systematically investigated by density functional theory for the first time. The results demonstrate that 2D InSe/MoSi<sub>2</sub>N<sub>4</sub> has a type-II band alignment with a favourable direct bandgap of 1.61 eV and exhibits suitable band edge positions for overall water splitting. Particularly, 2D InSe/MoSi<sub>2</sub>N<sub>4</sub> has high electron mobility (10<sup>4</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) and shows a noticeable optical absorption coefficient (10<sup>5</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup>) in the visible-light region of the solar spectrum. These brilliant properties declare that 2D InSe/MoSi<sub>2</sub>N<sub>4</sub> is a potential photocatalyst for overall water splitting.}

abstract = {Abstract All-inorganic lead-free Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub> perovskite-derivant quantum dots (QDs) have attracted tremendous attention due to their nontoxicity and unique optoelectronic properties. However, the traditional hot-injection method requires high temperatures and multiple ligands to confine the growth of QDs. Herein, a strategy is reported to spontaneously synthesize ultrasmall Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub> QDs within metal–organic-frameworks (MOFs) MOF-74 at room temperature (RT) with an average diameter of 4.33 nm. The obtained Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub> QDs exhibit an evident deep-blue emission with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinates of (0.17, 0.07), owing to the strong quantum confinement effect. Due to the protection of MOF-74, the Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub> QDs demonstrate superior stability, and the photoluminescence quantum yield retains 89% of the initial value after the storage of 1440 h under the environment with relative humidity exceeding 70%. Besides, triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion emission is observed within the composite of Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub>@MOF-74, which brings out apparent temperature-dependent photoluminescence. This study reveals a facile method for fabricating ultrasmall lead-free perovskite-derivant QDs at RT without multiple ligands. Besides, the temperature-dependent photoluminescence of Cs<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>I<sub>5</sub>@MOF-74 may open up a new way to develop the applications of temperature sensors or other related optoelectronic devices.},

abstract = {Abstract Perovskite-based optoelectronic devices have attracted considerable attention owing to their excellent device performances and facile solution processing. However, the toxicity and intrinsic instability of lead-based perovskites have limited their commercial development. Moreover, the provision of an efficient white emission from a single perovskite layer is challenging. Here, novel electrically excited white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) based on lead-free double perovskite Cs<sub>2</sub>AgIn<sub>0.9</sub>Bi<sub>0.1</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> quantum dots (QDs) without any phosphor are fabricated for the first time. Density functional theory calculations are carried out to clarify the mechanism of absorption and recombination in Cs<sub>2</sub>AgIn<sub>0.9</sub>Bi<sub>0.1</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> with Bi-doping breaking the parity-forbidden transition of the direct bandgap. Microzone optical and electronic characterizations reveal that the broadband emission of Cs<sub>2</sub>AgIn<sub>0.9</sub>Bi<sub>0.1</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> QDs originates from self-trapped excitons, and luminescent properties are unchanged after the film deposition. The QD-WLED exhibits excellent Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage color coordinates, correlated color temperature and relatively high color rendering index of (0.32, 0.32), 6432 K, and 94.5, respectively. The maximum luminance of 158 cd m<sup>−2</sup> is achieved by triphenylphosphine oxide passivation, and this lead-free QD-WLED exhibits a superior stability in ambient air with a long T<sub>50</sub> ≈48.53 min. Therefore, lead-free perovskite Cs<sub>2</sub>AgIn<sub>0.9</sub>Bi<sub>0.1</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> QDs are promising candidates for use in WLEDs in the future.},

abstract = {The unexpected visible-light absorption, low recombination of electron–hole pairs, and high carrier mobility are found in a novel two-dimensional (2D) InSe/Zr<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> van der Waals heterostructure for overall water splitting photocatalysis. The photocatalytic mechanism has been systematically investigated using first-principles calculations for the first time. We prove that the 2D InSe/Zr<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> heterostructure is a robust and promising visible-light photocatalyst with several distinct advantages, as follows. It has a direct band gap of 1.81 eV, which is a more favorable band gap for visible-light photocatalysis. Its type-II band alignment directly leads to a significant electron–hole separation with electrons (holes) localized in the InSe (Zr<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>) monolayer. The indirect band gap of the InSe (Zr<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>) monolayer further suppresses the electron–hole recombination in it. Naturally, the recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes is greatly suppressed in the InSe/Zr<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> heterostructure, which improves the solar energy utilization effectively. Moreover, a large optical absorption coefficient (10<sup>5</sup> cm<sup>–1</sup>) has been confirmed in the 2D InSe/Zr<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> heterostructure with the electron (hole) mobility reaching up to 10<sup>4</sup> (10<sup>3</sup>) cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>, which is highly beneficial and desirable for enhancing its photocatalytic efficiency.}

abstract = {The enhanced visible-light harvesting, low recombination of electron–hole pairs and high carrier mobility are found in a novel g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>/InSe hybrid two-dimensional (2D) heterostructure photocatalyst by using first-principles calculations for the first time. The photocatalytic mechanism of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>/InSe is comprehensively investigated. Our calculations show that 2D g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>/InSe heterostructure has a direct band gap of 1.93 eV and a typical type-II band alignment with holes and electrons located in metal-free g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> monolayer and non-noble metal InSe nanosheet, respectively. A remarkable visible-light absorption can thus be expected. The electrons and holes located in InSe and g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> monolayers have a high mobility (10<sup>4</sup> and 10<sup>2</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>), which is beneficial for improving the catalytic efficiency. The charge density difference and type-II band structure indicate that the photo-generated electrons easily transfer from g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> monolayer to InSe nanosheet, and the holes are transferred from InSe to g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, reducing the electron–hole recombination. Compared with the well-known 2D g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>/MoS<sub>2</sub> hybrid photocatalyst composed of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> nanosheet and MoS<sub>2</sub> monolayer with a low electron mobility (< 200 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>) and fast electron–hole recombination due to its direct bandgap, g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>/InSe heterostructure photocatalyst has a distinctive advantage in improving the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance due to the high carrier mobility and suppressing the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes by the indirect band gap of InSe monolayer. These clearly prove that g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>/InSe is an energetic photocatalyst for overall water splitting under visible-light irradiation.}
