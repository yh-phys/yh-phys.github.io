abstract = {The multi-hydrogen lanthanum hydride LaH<sub>10</sub> is well recognized as having the highest critical temperature (<i>T<sub>c</sub></i>) of 250–260 K under unrealistically ultrahigh pressures of about 170–200 GPa. Here, we propose a novel idea for designing a new ambient-pressure high-<i>T<sub>c</sub></i> superconductor by inserting a hexagonal H-monolayer into two close-packed Be monolayers to form a new and stable few-hydrogen metal-bonded layered beryllium hydride (Be<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>H nanosuperlattice, with better ductility than multi-hydrogen, cuprate, and iron-based superconductors, completely contrary to the conventional design strategy for multi-hydrogen covalent high-<i>T<sub>c</sub></i> superconductors with poor ductility at several hundred GPa. We find that (Be<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>H is a phonon-mediated Eliashberg superconductor with a large electron–phonon coupling constant of 1.41 and a high <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> of 84–72 K with Coulomb repulsion pseudopotential μ<sup>*</sup> = 0.07–0.13. Importantly, (Be<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>H is the only new high-<i>T<sub>c</sub></i> superconductor and fills the gap in the absence of ambient-pressure superconductors around the liquid-nitrogen temperature with good ductility, which is highly beneficial for practical applications.}
